# employee_attrition
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts employee attrition using HR data. Built with Streamlit, it provides an interactive interface for both single and batch predictions. The backend uses XGBoost and Decision Tree models, with data preprocessing and evaluation handled by Scikit-learn.
